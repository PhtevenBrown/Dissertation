# Hardware and Software for Live GPS Visualisation

Tracking a runner using a Raspberry Pi, displaying their live location and route on accompanying webpage with an OpenLayers map.

Tracker constructed from a Raspberry Pi Zero running `gps.py`, GPS/GPRS HAT and battery pack.

The university devweb which hosted the website and database has been shutdown but I've substituted any login information nonetheless.

`php/relay.php` was necessary to access the database, due to university policy on external access to the MySQL server.
